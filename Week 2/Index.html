            How stakeholder-friendly will companies feel in a falling market? The corporate consensus has shifted
            remarkably
            quickly to the idea that executives must manage for the long-term benefit of employees, consumers, suppliers
            and
            the planet — rather than focus only on meeting investor expectations for the next quarter.

            Yet this rebuke to the old doctrine of shareholder-primacy has come during a long bull market. Record
            profits
            have made it easier for chief executives to think magnanimously about constituents who have no power to oust
            them if they miss forecasts.
